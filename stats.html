  <h2>Messi Career graph</h2>
  </br></br>
  <p>Lionel Messi remains “the best player in history” regardless of what Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo may say or do, claims Barcelona spokesman Josep Vives."We have always considered him a great player and a great competitor.
"But here at the Camp Nou, we can see the best player in history every 15 days, which is Messi."
Barca have already addressed the issue of Messi’s future this season, with the 30-year-old forward having finally committed to a new contract through to 2021.
The La Liga giants are, however, yet to reveal what the future holds for another of their Argentine stars.
Javier Mascherano is tied to a deal until 2019, but a lack of game time is forcing him to look elsewhere.
The versatile 33-year-old has conceded that he may look to secure a switch during the winter transfer window, with a return to his homeland mooted.
Vives claims there is no update to report at present, with Barca working towards ensuring that their squad is not disrupted by any comings and goings in the new year.</p>
